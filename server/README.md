# Getting Started with Node Express backend app

Backend service is deployed on Heroku: https://govtacefootball.herokuapp.com/

If you wish to run locally you may have to edit certain files

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in terminal console.

### `npm start`

The page will run server.js on port 5000 locally.

### `npm devtest`

Concurrently runs both frontend and backend on terminal.\
This is for local hosting and as such would require to edit fetch operation on frontend \client\src\components\Game.js
